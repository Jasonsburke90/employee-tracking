# employee-tracking

## Description

This project is a team database for a company. The database allows a user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company to organize their business. Everything in the database is managed through the command line, and sent to a mySQL database. Functions for viewing Employees, Roles, and Departments, as well as for creating new Employees, Roles, and Departments, and updating Employees, are all implemented.
