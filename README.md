# employee-tracking

## Description

This project is a team database for a company. The database allows a user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company to organize their business. Everything in the database is managed through the command line, and sent to a mySQL database. Functions for viewing Employees, Roles, and Departments, as well as for creating new Employees, Roles, and Departments, and updating Employees, are all implemented.

Users will use the command line, initializing the app with node server.js.
